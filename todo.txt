Spell discovery:
  Runes placed in minecraft-esque fashion
  Discovering a certain attribute: shape and specific runes
  Town gives a spell for free. Example: healing. Show player that a plus and a certain rune is for healing
  Quests will then give players tips on the shape for a spell, or the rune for a spell
  Discovery != usage
  Specific runes needed is random for each player, to prevent easily 'cheating'  

Land ownership:
  Server owned, Player owned, and unclaimed
  Partition sectors to 4 plots
  Non-contiguous land has a one-tile border of undevelopable land, to prevent blocking parts of the world
  Plots in PVP zones can have chests/doors be pick locked
  Players can't build/destroy on land owned by other players or the server
  Server owned floors can only be improved. Grass -> dirt -> stone. Floors decay over use.
  Magic spell to see ownership
  After x amount of time, if player does not log in, their land is put up for auction by the town
  Taxes?
