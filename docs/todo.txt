getting back into the project:
________________________________
consolidate todos/backlog

newest version of Unity

focus on native client, put a pin in webplayer
  make option for webserver build in build script. toggle it off in a config file, for now
  go ahead and nuke the flash storage bridge from the repo. by the time webplayer comes back, it likely will have a better native storage solution

redo server
  groovy
  simplify networking
  use http for resources

project/dev.env. quality
  code lint
  sublime integration
  standardized file/resource naming (like-this.txt)
  clean up todos
  update instructions before next release
________________________________

  *****

  Create an arena for pvp testing
    warp stones

  Armor weight -> player speed
  Equipment determines actions available
    Spear - spike (optimal at 2 tiles away)
          - lunge (must be 1 tile away)

  Give warning/don't allow action if target is out of range
    - how to show warning?

  Should increase the HP a lot.

  Hits should show how much HP was removed
    - 
    a number shooting off the hit player?

  Attacks are time-action based (paper mario)
  Block attacks - think paper mario. give a cue that an attack is coming, and if GUARD action is done at certain time, the attack is mitigated a bit.
    visual cue - ?
    audio cue - ?
    Attacks can also be dodged, if the player is in the middle of a dash

  Strong/Fast attacks
    Fast - 1, 2, 3. quick attacks that have small blocking intervals.
    Strong - charge up. larger blocking interval

Priority features

  Assess how to refactor TileMapView
    Sprite Tiler?

  GridiaJsonMessageHandler
  transient entity properties
  player label is transparent

  Rolling: just give a direction, and it goes that way
    introduces new action type: directional

  Context menu, using items with mouse
  Tutorial island (~10-15 minutes)
    Deep water
  Objectives / Achievements
  NPC merchants
    Player owned
  Item ownership
  Land ownership
  Transition to IntelliJ
  Running into items uses equipped item on it.
    Equip pickaxe to mine
    Equip axe to cut down trees easier
  Convert entitites to unity objects
  Require def in scripts
  Probably need to cache scripts

Issues

  Sawwing sfx is static-y
  Player position gets out of sync?
  Usage -> Use
  freezes when minimized for awhile
  animations show in top left corner for split seconds
  issues when walking on edge of map
  drag-item-under-windows bug
  unity bridge request md5 hash
  WavFile - some sounds do not work. Woodcutting plays twice, why?
  you can equip stacks of items
  GZipStream does not work in Unity
  Clean up project structure
  Gridia namespace
  Unity doesn't compile this : 
    JsonConvert issue: data["id"].Value<int>() doesn't compile in Unity. Forced to do (int)data["id"]
  Client side hit prediction - worth doing?
  Graphical layering of items is messed up
  Filling in cave w/ shovel should destroy corresponding exit / entrance
  Item usages on creatures (Shearing sheep)
  Item drop issues - race conditions?
    Drop as backpack/corpse instead of all items
    Lost & found
    Main thread queue?

Controls

  move items between/within containers w/ keyboard
  right shift,ctrl,alt...
  equip item: ctrl + e

UI

  Map
  hand uses don't show in recipe book?
  Show slot number for items 1-10 in inventory
  Move 'next' button in recipe book to far right
  color of quantity labels

Refactor


  Coord -> Int3
  xxxGui -> xxxWindow
  itemusages -> usages
  Preloader
  State machine
  Test coverage
  Item.Item -> Item.Data
  lowercase-directory-names
  kill the Locator
  Everything!

Tests, code coverage and cyclomatic complexity

  ContentManager

Misc

  mute music on minimize
  commands:
    !kick
    !w

Crossplatform

  Linux
  Mac

Magic

  Spell discovery
    Runes placed in minecraft-esque fashion
    Discovering a certain attribute: shape and specific runes
    Town gives a spell for free. Example: healing. Show player that a plus and a certain rune is for healing
    Quests will then give players tips on the shape for a spell, or the rune for a spell
    Discovery != usage
    Specific runes needed is random for each player, to prevent easily 'cheating'  

Land ownership:

  Server owned, Player owned, and unclaimed
  Partition sectors to 4 plots
  Non-contiguous land has a one-tile border of undevelopable land, to prevent blocking parts of the world
  Plots in PVP zones can have chests/doors be pick locked
  Players can't build/destroy on land owned by other players or the server
  Server owned floors can only be improved. Grass -> dirt -> stone. Floors decay over use.
  Magic spell to see ownership
  After x amount of time, if player does not log in, their land is put up for auction by the town
  Taxes?

Nice-to-have

  'Chrome dark noise' on mining walls
  Different realms - 1:100 movement, one-way telporting to "oblivion"-like plane, fixed teleports back
  	temorary return gate, closes in 10 min, or cost mana?
  	permament gates take a lot of mana/ resources. time investment
  sfxr
  Water ripple effect
  speed up music during combat
  browser version
  auto-convert .ogg sounds files
  sparse map structure, procedual generation
  "ground status" - water, ploughed, etc... Allows for flooding areas, and other stuff
    bit-array on sector
    ploughed should be a ground status


Scripting todo:

  Refactor GridiaScript - DRY

  Attaching scripts - unattaching

  Creating creatures is wonky

  transient entity properties

========================
Script chat commands
========================

!entities (Shows all)

	monster1 - (ID, NAME, TYPE <monster/player/entity>)
	monster2
		script1
		script2
	world
		script1
		script2

!entity <id/name> - shows all scripts

!script inject <script instance id> <code to run>

!script rerun <script instance id>

!script list (shows all scripts known)
	script1
	script2
	script3
	script4

!script attach <scriptname> <entity id or name>

!script new scriptName <code> (creates a script)
