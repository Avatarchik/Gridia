For combat

  *****
  When using an action, a bar pops up. The bar has some intervals across it, which the player must press the key(s) displayed during.
  In defense zones, if the player attempts and fails, then they break that zone and lose guard %
  When the bar is full, the action is performed, hit takes place, and a cooldown occurs.
  During the cooldown, the player is vulnerable, based on the guard % they lost, and can't move. There is some sort of visual indicator above player for guard%/cooling down.

  Bar and zones are static. A ticker moves from left to right.
  Not attemtping a zones gives no penality. Attempting and failing has a penalty.
  Zone key-press types:
    A single key
    Multiple keys, which must be pressed in order
    Mash a single key as many times as possible
  Zone effect types
    Regular
      Succeeding adds some damage points/def %
      Attempting and failing takes off 50% of collected damage/collected def%
    Critical applier
      Attempting and failing deals the damage on self/reduces def% by 50

                                                 v                {} -> crit
