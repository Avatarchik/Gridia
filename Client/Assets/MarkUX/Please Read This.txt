====  Getting Started (brief)  =========================

This is a short introduction on how to get started. For a more comprehensive guide check out the latest getting started guide at http://www.markux.com/.

To create your first view follow these simple steps:

1. Create a view
Create a XML file and put it in the custom view-folder "Assets\Views" (you can right-click on the folder and select Assets->Create->View). All views (XML files) in this folder and subfolders will be automatically imported by the MarkUX editor extension upon changes. If you created the view manually, make sure it contains the following:

   <NewView>
       <Label Text="My New View" />
   </NewView>

 You now have a view called "NewView" that contains a text label.

2. Creating a View Presenter
In order to present the views the scene needs a Canvas with a View Presenter component added to it. Create a canvas in the scene (GameObject->UI->Canvas) and add the View Presenter component to it. Click "Reload Views" in the inspector window or make a change to the view XML and save - this will refresh the View Presenters list of views and themes. As "Main View" select the view you've created: "NewView". The scene should now show your first view. The UI gets generated under "LayoutRoot" in the canvas. 

Important: LayoutRoot is replaced when the view XML are updated so make sure not to put any important GameObjects under LayoutRoot.



====  Example Scenes  ==================================

The example scenes in MarkUX/Scenes/ showcases the standard views and the themes included in the framework.
